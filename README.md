# What I would do if I had a day

- create an unfavorite button, function, action
- type it better
- maybe not load everything every time - cache or store

# What I would do if I had more than a week

- I can see this turning into a cat app
- incorporate other APIs and invite users to join and share their cat text and media
- have both user-generated and api-generated content
- users come to share and explore
- make it compatible with fediverse -> easy adoption
- abstract the cat logic away and make a dog app alongside it
  - or generalize the app so it accommodates other animals
- use IPFS or gunjs for storage
- once secure enough, open-source
- monetization options include
  - sponsored content, e.g. cat food, dog house, bird cage
- **protect user privacy**
- make a separate app for video, incorporate in this app
- try out privacy-friendly recommendation algorithms
- support different media types
